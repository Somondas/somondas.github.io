            <br>
            <p style="margin-left:auto;">A motherboard can contain one or more sockets or slots to insert a processor. The socket type determines the type of processor used in a motherboard. The manufactures of sockets or slots define standards for the sockets or slots of a processor. Modern motherboards employ the Zero Insertion Force(ZIF) socket. In this type of socket, you use a socket lever to install and remove a processor in a motherboard. Intel-based motherboards use Socket 755(also known as Land Grid Array(LGA) 755 or Socket T) and support LGA 1155 which supports core i3, i5,i7 series processors.</p>

            <p>A memory socket in a motherboard contains RAM. Generally, two types of memory sockets are available in motherboards- Single-In-Line Memory Module(SIMM) and Double-In-Line Memory Module(DIMM).</p>
            <p>The memory sockets are:</p>

Modern motherboards consist of two distinct chipsets- Northbridge and Southbridge. The Northbridge chipset examines the communication and throughput speed between a processor, memory, and graphic card. The Southbridge chipset examines serial and parallel ports, USB support, and power management functions.</p>

            <p>A jumper can hold more than one setting. For example, suppose a motherboard has a jumper block with three pins labeled 1, 2, and 3. The jumper can be placed over pins  1 and 2 for one setting or pins 2 and 3 for a different setting.</p>
            <p>You can put the jumper over a single pin in the jumper block rather than placing it in an isolated place if it is not in use. However, placing the jumper over a single pin does not allow anything, but keeps the jumper safe convenient for future use.</p>
