            <p>Touch typing is one of the skills that I learned from the internet and which I used every day while editing my site and doing my school assignments and it saves a lot of time. My average typing speed is 50 WPM(Words Per Minute) but you may have seen many people typing at   95 WPM or 200 WPM, you don't need to go that fast but if your typing speed is less than 30 WPM then you are a slow typer. Speed typing is a very essential skill that you should learn, it can help you earn(that rhymes). Yes, you can earn from speed-typing by "data-entry" as a freelancer where you can earn 10$ to 20$ per hour. Now, I will show you the sites and apps from where I learned touch typing without paying a single penny.</p> 
            <p><u><b>What is touch typing?</b></u></p>
            <p>Touch typing or blind typing is a style of typing where you type without using the sense of sight to find a particular key.  a touch typist will know their location on the keyboard through muscle memory.</p>
            <p><u><b>Where to learn touch typing? </b></u></p>
            <p>There are many websites where you can learn touch typing. But I think <a href="https://www.keybr.com">'keybr.com'</a> is the best free site to learn touch typing. It doesn't require any login and it's completely free. Login is optional, but if you don't log in, your typing data is stored locally and is accessible only from your current computer. Creating an account will store your typing data on their servers in the cloud. This will allows you to access your profile from any computer or browser.</p>
            <p>Keybr.com has many features like dark mode, Beginner mode, advance mode, etc. You can also set your lesson length. You can also play a multiplayer game which will make you faster.</p>
            <p>You can also track your progress and days in the profile section. It took me 33 days to learn touch typing. I was practicing  30 min every day so in total it took 16 hours and 30 minutes to learn touch typing. </p>

            <p><b><u>Tips for those who don't want to learn touch typing</u></b></p>
            <p>If you don't want to learn touch typing, here are some tips that you can follow to increase your typing speed:</p>
            <p><b>Use both hands for typing</b></p>
            <p> Of course, you have to type using both hands. I see many of my friends who don't use both hands and they are slow as hell. So, try to use your both hands while typing. </p>
            <p><b> Use your thumb to press the space bar</b></p>
            <p>Use both thumbs to press the spacebar and you will notice that your typing speed is increasing. </p>
            <p><b>Use keyboard shortcuts</b></p>
            <p> Windows 10 has tones of <a href="shortcuts.html">keyboard shortcuts</a> that you can memorize and minimize the use of the mouse.</p>
            <p><b>Use your pinky fingers to press 'Shift', 'Enter', and 'Backspace'</b></p>
            <p>Use your right pinky finger to press the 'Enter' key, 'Right Shift' key, and the 'Backspace' key. And use your left pinky finger to press the 'Left Shift', 'Left Ctrl, and the 'Capslock' key.</p>
            <p><b>Use the 'Shift' key instead of 'Caps Lock'</b></p>
            <p>Instead of using the Caps lock key, you can use the Shift key to capitalize a letter. Just press and hold the Shift key and press the letter you want to capitalize.</p>
